# bwd-backend

The start of our API for the Beginning Web Development meetup group.

## Getting Started
Clone the repo and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project, this is where we will be storing all of our secrets, and add the following: 
```
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=CHECK_DISCORD/JIRA
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=3d
```


## Running the server
Run `npm run dev` to start the server. The server will restart automatically when you make changes to the code.
